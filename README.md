Chance of fossil preservation
-----------------------------

Taxon ranges through T stages. Each stage has X occurrences of taxon.
X ~ Pois(\lambda).

Set this up hierarchically. Each taxon is in a group (genus in order). Each
group is part of a larger group (order in class). Final level is the super group
(class in hard-part inverts).

Overdispersed Poisson is Negative Binomial (Gamma mixed with Poisson).
