Project on accumulation of regional diversity
=============================================

Multiple aspects floating around. Now everything is [cadaverous
bloom](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3529).

- HMM of brachiopod regional occurrence for the Paleozoic. Considered too
  derivative.
- Something better. I'm having trouble making original thoughts right now.
- accumulation of regional species pool
  - macroevolution of macroecology
    - community members are drawn from species pool
    - what creates species pool?
      - conceptual distance between community and global diversity
  - turnover slash stability
    - "waves of diversity"
  - capture-mark-recapture model
    - migration as predictor for both origination and extinction
    - other covariates
      - coast? E, W, E+W
        - time varying effect (for detecting events)?
        - time varying covariate
      - larval form/mode?
  - New Zealand bivalves and/or gastropods
    - opening of Drake's Passage
    - closing of the isthmus of Panama
    - closing of the Arabian peninsula
